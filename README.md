# Smart Predictive Analytics for Hospital Supply Chain and Resource Optimization

## Project Description
This project focuses on optimizing hospital resources to dynamically balance emergency and routine care demands. Hospitals often face challenges in meeting unexpected surges in emergency patients while maintaining sufficient resources for scheduled, routine care. Utilizing patient inflow data (both scheduled and unscheduled visits), historical demand patterns, and seasonal data, this project aims to create an adaptable model that anticipates fluctuations in demand and adjusts resource allocation accordingly.

## Key Components
- **Emergency vs. Routine Patient Inflow Analysis:** 
  - Analyze historical patient inflow data to categorize patients into emergency and routine care.
  - Identify peak times for both patient types and track patterns, including seasonal surges and daily peaks.

- **Staff Workload and Shift Optimization:**
  - Calculate staff workload by department and time to ensure adequate coverage during high-demand periods.
  - Propose dynamic shift scheduling, assigning staff based on predicted inflow and workload intensity.

- **Real-time Inventory and Supply Chain Monitoring:**
  - Implement real-time monitoring of essential resources, including medical supplies, equipment, and beds.
  - Develop predictive models to anticipate shortages and automate restocking based on projected demand.

- **Forecasting for Emergency Preparedness:**
  - Create predictive models to forecast potential emergencies or unexpected demand spikes using historical trends and external events (e.g., flu season, natural disasters).
  - Establish an emergency preparedness plan that allows for quick scaling of resources during demand surges.

- **Cost-Effective Resource Utilization:**
  - Incorporate cost analysis to minimize wastage by aligning resource levels with anticipated patient demand.
  - Generate resource utilization reports to identify areas for cost savings, especially during low-demand periods.

- **Visualization Dashboards for Decision Support:**
  - Develop interactive dashboards in Power BI for hospital administrators to view real-time data on patient inflow, staff workload, and resource levels.
  - Implement alerts for resource thresholds, helping staff proactively manage critical supply levels and labor allocation.

## Suggested Datasets
- **Patient Inflow Data:** Contains timestamps, patient type (emergency/routine), and department.
- **Hospital Staffing Data:** Includes staff shifts, department assignments, workload, and skill levels.
- **Medical Supply Chain Data:** Tracks inventory levels, usage rates, and order history.
- **Seasonal Data and External Events:** Public health data for seasonal trends and flu outbreaks to understand external influences on patient flow.
- **Cost Data:** Detailed cost information for resources and labor to enable cost-benefit analysis.

## Languages and Tools Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python, R
- **Data Visualization Tools:** Power BI, Tableau
- **Database Management:** SQL
- **Data Analysis Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Other Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git for version control

## Value Proposition
This project offers hospitals a proactive approach to managing unpredictable patient flow, enhancing both patient care and resource efficiency. It provides insights into balancing emergency and routine care demands, supports staff well-being by managing workloads effectively, and reduces operational costs by closely aligning resources with patient demand. Through comprehensive analytics and visualization, the project aims to create a sustainable framework for better resource management in healthcare settings.
